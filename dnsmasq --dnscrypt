To configure dnsmasq, copy the example configuration to /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
and edit to taste.

  cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

To have launchd start dnsmasq at startup:
  sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
  sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
Then to load dnsmasq now:
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist


######

cp $(brew list dnsmasq | grep /dnsmasq.conf.example$) /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo cp $(brew list dnsmasq | grep /homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist$) /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist

To start and stop dnsmasq, you can use these commands:
sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq

For simplicity you can then append your zones directly in /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf or you can uncomment this line:
conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d
and add one file per zone in /etc/dnsmasq.d/.
