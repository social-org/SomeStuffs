To configure dnsmasq, copy the example configuration to /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
and edit to taste.

  cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

To have launchd start dnsmasq at startup:
  sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
  sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
Then to load dnsmasq now:
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
